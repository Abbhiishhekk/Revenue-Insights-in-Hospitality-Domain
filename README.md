# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain
This project focuses on analyzing revenue data within the hospitality industry to derive actionable insights. By leveraging key financial and operational metrics, the goal is to optimize decision-making, improve profitability, and drive business performance in areas such as room bookings, occupancy, and overall guest services.

Key Metrics Tracked:
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): Measures how effectively available rooms generate revenue.

Formula: RevPAR = Total Room Revenue / Total Available Rooms

Formula: ADR = Total Room Revenue / Number of Rooms Sold
Occupancy Rate: Provides insights into room utilization.

Formula: Occupancy Rate = Number of Rooms Occupied / Total Available Rooms
Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room (GOPPAR): Evaluates profitability after accounting for operating costs.

Goals:
Optimize Revenue: By identifying underperforming areas and improving room pricing strategies.
Enhance Profitability: By reducing costs and improving overall operational efficiency.
Data-Driven Decisions: Leverage data to improve marketing strategies, adjust room rates, and manage inventory more effectively.
Tools & Technologies:
Excel for data extraction and transformation.
Data visualization tool Power BI to present findings.
